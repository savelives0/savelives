														<h3>THERE'S NO VACCINE FOR HUNGER… BUT THERE IS A SOLUTION, IF WE ACT NOW.</h3>
													</header>
													<b><p>As parts of the world vaccinate against COVID-19, millions of children are facing a hunger crisis brought on by conflict, climate and the lasting impact of the pandemic.  

														Hunger levels were already at record global highs before the pandemic and are now threatening to rise exponentially. Despite huge progress in our lifetimes, COVID-19 is adding to the impacts of conflict and climate change to push millions of people across the world - in places you wouldn’t expect - to the verge of starvation.  
														
														Save the Children is already working in many of these communities to support families with food, cash, and supplies, so their children don’t go hungry, now or in the future. We’re also working with partners to help communities spot early warning signs and take necessary measures to protect themselves. 
														
														We’ve avoided famines before - and we can do it again. </p></b>

														<h3>HOW HAS COVID-19 MADE THE HUNGER CRISIS WORSE?</h3>
													</header>
													<b><p>Even before the pandemic, one child in three under the age of five was malnourished. The coronavirus pandemic has thrown huge unprecedented challenges and pressures onto already strained health systems, fragile economies, food systems and livelihoods. The pandemic has increased the risk of hunger for millions of children worldwide, in some ways you may not have expected.</p></b>

														<h3>NALA’S STORY.</h3>
													</header>
													<b><p>Nala* is a mother of five children, including one-year-old Ahmed*. They all live with Nala’s brother in a camp for displaced people in Puntland, Somalia.

														As the current drought intensifies, the job market is drying up and impacting on the family’s income. As a result, Nala has been forced to reduce the number of meals they eat a day, and they can no longer afford to buy clean drinking water. Ahmed became sick and malnourished.
														
														Nala took Ahmed to a Save the Children supported stabilisation centre, where he was diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition and is currently receiving treatment. He is making a steady recovery and has started to smile, laugh, and play again, much to Nala’s relief.
														
														Nala said: “When I first brought him here he was unable to move around. But now he’s had the milk and  the peanut paste he’s able to talk to me and play. Apart from the medicine and milk they’ve giving Ahmed, they’re also providing me with three meals a day so I can concentrate on looking after my son. I want to see my children grow and live a better life in the future. That’s my hope for my children.”</p></b>

														<h3>Suffering From Severe Hunger.</h3>
													</header>
													<b><p>The effects of the pandemic have been apparent across Zimbabwe. Climate-related disasters, such as drought and cyclones, are being complicated by economic downturn and high unemployment being worsened by the COVID-19 outbreak. Children like 3-year-old Andrian* (above) are feeling the effects of these crises which have led her mother Vimbai to resort to begging for food from her neighbours. Thankfully, our Emergency Health Unit was able to assess Andrian for malnutrition in a survey which told us more about the levels of food insecurity in the country.</p></b>

														<h3>"I LIE AWAKE AT NIGHT THINKING OF THE CHILDREN WE CAN’T REACH": AFGHANISTAN'S DOCTORS AT BREAKING POINT AS PNEUMONIA AND HUNGER SOAR</h3>
													</header>
													<b><p>Pneumonia cases are soaring in Afghanistan, killing children who are unable to access healthcare facilities, Save the Children said today.

														An assessment by the children’s agency found that in December more than half (55%) of surveyed households who needed healthcare in the prior three months weren’t able to get it. Half of surveyed parents said their children have had pneumonia in the preceding two weeks.
														
														Child pneumonia is surging in the middle of a hunger crisis that is ravaging young immune systems. The collapse of the health system, driven largely by frozen financial assets and withdrawn aid, comes at a deadly cost for Afghan children.
														
														One doctor at a hospital in the north of the country said he had never seen so many cases of child pneumonia and severe malnutrition. Children are laying two, three or even four to a bed. He told Save the Children that 135 children had died in or on their way to the hospital in December – the majority fighting for breath from pneumonia, and 40 severely malnourished.</p></b>

														<h3>State of the World's Children.</h3>
													</header>
													<b><p>Every child has the right to health, education and protection, and every society has a stake in expanding children’s opportunities in life. Yet, around the world, millions of children are denied a fair chance for no reason other than the country, gender or circumstances into which they are born.

														Poverty affects children disproportionately. Around the world, one out of six children lives in extreme poverty, living on less than US$1.90 a day. Their families struggle to afford the basic health care and nutrition needed to provide them a strong start. These deprivations leave a lasting imprint; in 2019, 149 million children under the age of five were stunted.s.</p></b>

													</header>
													<b><p>One year since the Myanmar military seized power in a coup, the scale and severity of violence against civilians, including children and humanitarian staff, is escalating, Save the Children said today. In the past two weeks alone, children have been killed in several bombings and raids by the military in Kayah state[i] and Sagaing region[ii][iii][iv], including the bombing of a camp for internally displaced people (IDPs) in Kayah. In the past year, at least 150,000 children have been forced to flee their homes[v].</p></b>

														<h3>Children and armed conflict</h3>
													</header>
													<b><p>In 2019, 1.6 billion children (69%) were living in a conflict-affected country, and approximately 426 million children (over one in six) were living in a conflict zone. Millions of children, many of whom are unaccompanied or separated from their families are being displaced by armed conflict. These children are at a high risk of grave violations in and around camps, and other areas of refuge. Action is urgently required to alleviate the plight of children displaced by armed conflict and the Secretary-General encourages Member States to respect the rights of displaced and refugee children and to provide them with necessary support services.</p></b>

This challenge is compounded by the increasingly protracted nature of armed conflict.</p></b>
